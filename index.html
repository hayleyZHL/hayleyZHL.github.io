                    to effectively communicate information.

                    <p class="project_info_text">Following the recent shutdown of Silicon Valley Bank, I began to ponder whether this is a sign of another recession,
                        or if we are already in one. To gain some perspective, I took a look at similar bank failures that have occurred in the past few decades.
                        As a result, I have put together a visualization of bank failure cases since 2000.

                    <p class="project_info_text">If you're looking to explore the businesses of a particular area, what's the best way to do so using visualization?
                        One effective approach is to apply the context + focus design principle. This allows users to obtain an overview of all the businesses in the
                        area while also being able to access specific details about a business they may be interested in.

                        we take a closer look at the distribution of crime and businesses in Philadelphia. As expected,
                        we found that higher crime rates tend to correlate with fewer businesses.
                        However, we also discovered one district that has high numbers of both businesses and crimes.

                        it's a good time to start a new venture. To shed some light on this topic, we've visualized the reviews of businesses before
                        and after the pandemic. It appears that there has been a significant drop in the number of reviews for businesses on Yelp.

                    <p class="project_info_text">
                        Our climate is changing dramatically, largely due to the extra greenhouse gases emitted by human activities.
                        Planting more trees can help mitigate these effects, and not to mention, trees are beautiful! Curious about San Francisco's
                        tree planting efforts? Our visualization offers insights into the popular types of trees, the number of trees planted, and more.
